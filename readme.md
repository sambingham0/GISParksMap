# National and State Parks Map

Access: https://sambingham0.github.io/GISParksMap/

## Overview

To expand my skills as a software developer, I decided to gain hands-on experience with **ArcGIS** by creating an interactive map application.

This program provides a map displaying **National and State Parks** across the United States. Users can search for parks by name and explore locations using a **feature layer**. Each park includes relevant details, improving accessibility and ease of discovery. The data is sourced from an **ArcGIS Feature Service** (URL listed in **Useful Resources**).

While this project primarily served as a learning experience in **GIS mapping**, it also provides a practical tool for park enthusiasts.
